# less-to-sass

A simple helper for converting less to sass.

Clone down this repo and then drop your files into the `input` directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:freeqaz/less-to-sass.git
cd less-to-sass
npm install
npm run convert
# Files now exist in output folder!
```

By default, it will export `.scss` files. You can change this in the `Gruntfile.js` by changing the config.
